    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Brownies get better with age, so always try to make them a day ahead. Let them cool completely in the pan â€“ they are very soft when hot and can break easily.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>125g unsalted butter, chopped</li>
        <li>125g CADBURY Baking Dark Chocolate, chopped </li>
        <li>3 eggs, lightly whisked </li>

        <li>115g (3/4 cup) plain flour</li>
        <li>30g (1/4 cup) Dutch cocoa powder </li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract </li>
        <li>Pinch of salt </li>

    </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180C/160C fan forced. Grease a 20cm (base measurement) square cake pan and line with baking paper. </li>
            <li>Place butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (don't let the bowl touch the water). Stir with a metal spoon until melted. Remove from heat.
